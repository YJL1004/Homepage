abstract = {Multiple kernel clustering (MKC) is popular in processing non-linear data over the past years. The main challenge is that the kernel matrix with the size n×n leads to high memory and computational consumption, where n denotes the number of samples. Although the widely used static anchor sampling can mitigate such a challenging considerably, how to dynamically select anchor points with a learning manner from kernel matrix is a difficult problem. To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel method dubbed as cluster center consistency guided sampling learning (3CSL) for multiple kernel clustering (3CSL-MKC). Specifically, by taking the cluster center consistency between the original partial kernel data and anchor points into consideration, 3CSL-MKC learns the shared anchor sampling matrix gradually. With the help of high-quality anchors, the essential clustering information of each kernel partition can be transformed largely into a concentrated low-dimensional representation matrix. Meanwhile, based on dictionary learning, 3CSL-MKC fuses these candidate representation matrixes to produce the resulting consensus representation, such that the clustering assignments can be directly obtained relying on simple k-means. A large number of experiments are conducted on different multiple kernel datasets to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.}

abstract = {Multiple kernel clustering (MKC) has demonstrated promising performance for handing non-linear data clustering. Positively, it can integrate complementary information of multiple base kernels and avoid kernel function selection. However, negatively, the main challenging is that the kernel matrix with the size n x n leads to O(n2) memory complexity and O(n3) computational complexity. To mitigate such a challenging, taking graph Laplacian as breakthrough, this paper proposes a novel and simple MKC method, dubbed as approximate shifted Laplacian reconstruction (ASLR). For each base kernel, we propose the r-rank shifted Laplacian reconstruction scheme by considering the energy losing of Laplacian reconstruction and the clustering information preserving of Laplacian decompose simultaneously. Then, by analyzing the eigenvectors of the reconstructed Laplacian, we impose some constrains to tame its solution within a Fantope. Accordingly, the byproduct (i.e. the most informative eigenvectors) contains the main clustering information, such that the clustering assignments can be obtained relying on simple k-means algorithm. Owe to the Laplacian reconstruction scheme, the memory and computational complexity can be reduced to O(n) and O&lt;(n^2)$, respectively. As experimentally demonstrated on eight challenging MKC benchmark datasets, the results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of ASLR.},

Proverbially, anchor strategy can mitigate such a challenge a certain extent. However, the unsupervised dynamic strategy usually cannot obtain the optimal anchors for MVC. The main reasons are that it does not consider the fairness of different views and lacks the priori supervised guidance. To completely solve these problems, we first propose the priori anchor graph regularization (PAGG) for scalable multi-view bipartite graph clustering, dubbed as SMGC method. Specifically, SMGC learns a few representative consensus anchors to simulate the numerous view data well, and constructs a bipartite graph to bridge the affinities between the anchors and original data points. In order to largely improve the quality of anchors, PAGG predefines prior anchor labels to constrain the anchors with discriminative cluster structure and fair view allocation, such that a better bipartite graph can be obtained for fast clustering. Experimentally, abundant of experiments are accomplished on six scalable benchmark datasets, and the experimental results fully demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our SMGC.}, number={9}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={You, Jiali and Ren, Zhenwen and You, Xiaojian and Li, Haoran and Yao, Yuancheng}, year={2023}, month={Jun.}, pages={10972-10979} }

  abstract = "Tensor-based multi-view clustering has attracted intensive
              attention due to the effectiveness of exploiting multi-view data
              information. However, most existing methods purely aim to explore
              the consistency of different views while neglecting the inherent
              difference between views, which may lead to incomplete modeling
              and affect the final clustering performance. To handle this
              problem, in this paper, we unify the consistency and specificity
              to model the multi-view data in a tensor manner. Specifically, we
              learn multiple candidate graphs corresponding to all views
              through self-expressiveness learning. Then these candidate graphs
              are decomposed into two sets of graphs, i.e., consistent graphs
              and specific graphs, respectively. After that, these consistent
              graphs are stacked into a tensor to exploit the high-order
              structure information while the specific graphs are used to
              capture the inherent difference in each view, such that a refined
              consensus affinity graph can be obtained for spectral clustering.
              The established model is dubbed Consider High-Order Consistency
              for Multi-View Clustering (CHOC-MVC), and its optimal problem can
              be efficiently solved by the alternating direction method of
              multipliers (ADMM). The experimental results demonstrate the
              effectiveness of our proposed method. The source code is
